## Reflection
* A question within the context of today’s lab assignment 
  ** I guess my main question is how to remove the second language without breaking everything :) 
* An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment 
  ** I think this exercise was good in solidifying the communication between files, I'm still not at FULL understanding but I'm better off than I was when I started this lab 
* How long you spent working on this assignment 
  ** Haha let's not talk about that... but really I guess it took me about 5 hours
