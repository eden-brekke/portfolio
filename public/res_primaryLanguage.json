I enjoy the problem solving process that came with being a scientist so much that I sought out new and fun ways to apply that skill and further my career. I enjoy many things in life, but my favorite way to spend my time is with my little family, consisting of my partner and two kitties, and video games. I hope you enjoy my portfolio. ðŸ’œ",

We were limited by the scope of the class in that we couldn't call an API to draw 5 letter coding terminology, so instead our team hard-coded coding terms and descriptions into a constructor an drew from that pool of 45 terms. My main contribution to the project was getting the on-screen keyboard to function, the letters to render on screen in real time, the css and the animations for when you guessed incorrect letters, and for when you've guessed the correct word!",
