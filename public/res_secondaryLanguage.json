    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hey y'all! I'm Eden and I'm a software developer. Throughout my life I have had a long standing comfort and familiarity with computers, and though I've always had an ember of interest in programming, it is not something I pursued until recently. Instead I have a background in Virology research where I spent most of my career as a research scientist and a lab manager. During my time at the lab, a kind software engineer wrote a small program for us that changed an assay that took hours out of our day and made it take minutes instead, it completely changed our daily approach in lab. This small act really stoked that ember of existing interest into a passion for wanting to learn software development. So I could make programs similar to that. My career goals aren't to make a complete switch from my science background, but instead to make a shift. I want to take my knowledge of software development and bring it back into the world of science, I want to use it to push development of medicine and the betterment of our society. ðŸ’œ",

We were limited by the scope of the class in that we couldn't call an API to draw 5 letter coding terminology, so instead our team hard-coded coding terms and descriptions into a constructor an drew from that pool of 45 terms. My main contribution to the project was getting the on-screen keyboard to function, the letters to render on screen in real time, the css and the animations for when you guessed incorrect letters, and for when you've guessed the correct word!",
