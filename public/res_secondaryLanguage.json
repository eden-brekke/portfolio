I enjoy the problem solving process that came with being a scientist so much that I sought out new and fun ways to apply that skill and further my career. I enjoy many things in life, but my favorite way to spend my time is with my little family, consisting of my partner and two kitties, and video games. I hope you enjoy my portfolio. ðŸ’œ",

It was important to not only be punctual and careful within this job, it was also important to be self motivated. It's the sort of job where you have every excuse in the world to not make it back from a delivery quickly, and it's all self motivation to be a good worker. It helped me learn what kind of employee I am, and I found that I am dependable and reliable through this experience.",
